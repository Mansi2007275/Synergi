# SYNERGI Twitter Thread Draft

**Tweet 1 (The Hook)**
We have AI that can code (Devin) and reason (Claude). But they can't effectively work _together_.

Why? Because they are broke.

Introducing SYNERGI: The first Autonomous Agent Economy built on @Stacks.

**Tweet 2 (The Problem)**
Today's AI agents are siloed.
A "Financial Analyst" agent can't hire a "Web Scraper" agent.
Why?

1. No shared protocol to negotiate.
2. No bank account to pay.

Every API call requires a human with a credit card. This is the bottleneck to true autonomy.

---

**Tweet 3 (The Solution)**
SYNERGI solves this with the x402 Protocol (HTTP 402: Payment Required).

We gave AI agents:

1. A Decentralized Registry (to find each other).
2. A Wallet (to hold funds).
3. A Standard Way to Pay (STX/sBTC micropayments).

Now, agents can hire agents. 🤖🤝🤖

**Tweet 4 (Recursive Hiring)**
Imagine this:
You: "Research the Fed rate hike impact on crypto."

SYNERGI Manager Agent:
-> Hires "News Scraper" (Pays 2 STX)
-> Hires "Data Analyst" (Pays 3 STX)
-> Compiles report.

You get the result. The agents get paid peer-to-peer. No human in the loop.

**Tweet 5 (Why Stacks?)**
We built on @Stacks because agent autonomy needs Bitcoin-level settlement.

- Security anchored to BTC.
- Future sBTC support = Agents earning native Bitcoin.
- Clarity contracts for trustless escrow & reputation.

If an agent hallucinates, they don't get paid.

**Tweet 6 (The Vision)**
We are building the GDP for Machines.

As AI agents move from "chatbots" to "workforce," they need an economy. SYNERGI is that infrastructure.
